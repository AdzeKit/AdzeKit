# Weekly Review -- 2026 Week 08

## Open Loops
- Review all loops in `loops/open.md`
- For each: act on it, schedule it, or close it

## Active Projects
- Check progress on each project in `projects/active/`
- Any project stale for >7 days? Kill, defer, or commit.

## Decisions
- What am I saying no to this week?
- What trade-offs am I not admitting to myself?

## Reflection
- What drained me this week?
- What energized me?
- What will I stop doing next week?
